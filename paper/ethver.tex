\subsection{RPS v3}

\subsubsection{Code}

\lstinputlisting{../examples/rps_v3.etv}

\subsubsection{Properties (same as for v4)}

\lstinputlisting{../examples/rps_v3.props}

\subsubsection{Setup honest-honest}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ADVERSARY=-1, target = 2/3, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=-1, target = 2/3, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=-1, target = 2/3, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=-1, target = 2/3, result = 2/3
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Setup honest-adversary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ADVERSARY=1, target = 2/3, result = 0
\item ADVERSARY=1, target = 2/3, result = 1
\item ADVERSARY=0, target = 2/3, result = 0
\item ADVERSARY=0, target = 2/3, result = 1
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Player 1 can wait until player 0 opens his commitment and in case he knows he is going to lose, he can 
avoid to open his own commitment.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solution}
Introduce a penalty: if a player does not open the commitment within some timeframe, he loses.

\subsection{RPS v4}

\subsubsection{Code}

\lstinputlisting{../examples/rps_v4.etv}

\subsubsection{Properties}

\lstinputlisting{../examples/rps_v4.props}

\subsubsection{Setup (with fairness)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ADVERSARY=1, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=1, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=0, result = 2/3
\item ADVERSARY=0, result = 2/3
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Comments}

\begin{itemize}
\item First property (line 1) checks whether player 0 wins or draws with probability at lest 2/3 (with ADVERSARY=1)
\item Second property (line 3) checks wheter player 0 wins with probability at least 1/3 which is equivalent to player 0
loses with probability at most 2/3. (Also ADVERSARY = 1)
\item The next two properties analogously for honest player0 and ADVERSARY=0.
\end{itemize}
